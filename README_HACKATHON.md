# HealthID: Your AI-Powered Global Health Wallet 🌍🏥

**Built with gpt-oss-20b for the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon**

## 🎯 One Health Identity. Anywhere. Anytime. With AI That Understands You.

Imagine traveling from Kenya to the US, visiting a hospital, and having all your medical data automatically added to your secure health wallet. When you return home, your local AI assistant analyzes everything - spotting patterns, warning you about risks, and even preparing you for your next destination. **All processing happens locally on YOUR device. Your health data never leaves your control.**

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

Every year, millions of people:
- **Lose critical health information** when crossing borders
- **Undergo duplicate tests** because providers can't access their history  
- **Miss dangerous health patterns** that span multiple visits
- **Get sick while traveling** due to lack of personalized health preparation
- **Can't get timely alerts** about concerning trends in their lab results

## 💡 Our Solution: HealthID + Local AI Reasoning

HealthID combines:
1. **Decentralized Health Wallet**: Your medical data follows you globally
2. **gpt-oss-20b Local Reasoning**: Private AI analysis that never touches the cloud
3. **Smart Alerts**: Automatic detection of health anomalies with SMS/email notifications
4. **Travel Health Advisor**: Personalized health recommendations based on your destination's climate and disease risks
