# Decentralized Healthcare Identity Management Platform
# HealthID

A **self-sovereign healthcare data platform** that enables secure, privacy-respecting connections and data sharing between healthcare providers and patients using verifiable credentials. Built from scratch without external dependencies.

## üéØ Current Focus: Lab Result Sharing MVP

This MVP demonstrates patient-controlled sharing of lab results through verifiable credentials, providing a foundation for broader healthcare identity management.

## Key Components and Data Flow:

### 1. **Verifiable Credential System**:
   - **Self-hosted** credential management with cryptographic signatures for data integrity
   - Patient-controlled access permissions with time-based expiration
   - Complete audit trail of all credential verifications and access attempts

### 2. **Issuer (Labs & Healthcare Organizations)**:
   - Issue verifiable lab result credentials directly to patients
   - Cryptographically signed credentials ensure authenticity and tamper-resistance
   - Built-in integration with existing lab workflows

### 3. **Holder (Patient)**:
   - Full control over personal health credentials
   - Grant/revoke access to specific providers with customizable duration (1 hour to 1 month)
   - Real-time visibility into who has accessed their data and when

### 4. **Verifier (Hospitals, Insurance Providers, Doctors)**:
   - Instant verification of authentic lab results without direct lab communication
   - Cryptographic validation ensures data integrity and authenticity
   - Secure access only when explicitly granted by patient

## üöÄ Features Implemented:

### **Credential Issuance**
- Labs create lab results that automatically generate verifiable credentials
- Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering
- Structured data format with test name, values, reference ranges, dates

### **Patient Control Center**
- Dashboard showing all lab result credentials
- Grant temporary access to healthcare providers (1 hour to 1 month)
- Revoke access instantly at any time
- View access history and active permissions

### **Secure Verification**
- Healthcare providers verify credentials through secure API
- Automatic validation of signatures, expiration, and access permissions
- Complete audit logging for compliance and security

### **Privacy & Security**
- Patient data encrypted at rest (Rails 7 encryption)
- All access attempts logged with IP addresses and timestamps
- Time-limited access tokens prevent indefinite data access
- No central authority controls patient data

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture:

### **Backend**
- **Ruby on Rails 7.0** - Web application framework

## üìã Getting Started:

### **Prerequisites**
- Ruby 3.4.5
- PostgreSQL
- Rails 7.0

### **Setup**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd Health-ID

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Setup database
rails db:create
rails db:migrate

# Start server
rails server
```

### **Demo Flow**
1. **Register as a Lab** - Company account that can issue credentials
2. **Register as a Patient** - Individual account that controls data access
3. **Issue Lab Result** - Lab creates verifiable lab result for patient
4. **Grant Access** - Patient shares credential with healthcare provider
5. **Verify Credential** - Provider views authentic, verified lab result

## üéØ MVP Use Case: Lab Result Sharing

**Problem Solved**: Patients often can't easily share lab results between providers, leading to duplicate tests and delayed care.

**Solution**: Labs issue verifiable digital credentials that patients control and share instantly with any healthcare provider.

**Benefits**:
- **For Patients**: Instant sharing, complete control, no duplicate tests
- **For Labs**: Reduced administrative overhead, secure data sharing
- **For Providers**: Instant access to verified results, reduced fraud risk
- **For Healthcare System**: Lower costs, better care coordination

## üîÆ Future Roadmap:

### **Phase 2: Additional Credentials**
- Vaccination records
- Prescription history  
- Medical imaging reports
- Insurance verification

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Mobile app for patients
- API integrations with major EHR systems
- Blockchain-based immutable audit logs
- Zero-knowledge proof implementations

### **Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Insurance claim automation
- Clinical trial participant verification
- Telemedicine credential sharing
- Cross-border healthcare data portability

## üè• Market Validation:

This MVP addresses real healthcare pain points:
- **$150B+ annually** spent on healthcare data reconciliation
- **5-10% of insurance claims** are fraudulent due to identity issues  
- **Average patient** sees 3-5 different providers who can't easily share data
- **Regulatory compliance** (HIPAA, GDPR) requires detailed audit trails
